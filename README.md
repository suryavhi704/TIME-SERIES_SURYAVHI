**Project Title:**
**Time Series Forecasting on Airline Passenger Data Using SARIMAX**

**Project Description:**
This project involves a comprehensive time series analysis on airline passenger data, carried out as part of a hands-on session conducted by Intellipaat experts. The primary objective was to understand the underlying patterns in the data and develop a robust forecasting model.

**Key Activities and Methodologies:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Performed initial analysis to understand the structure and trends in the dataset. Key statistics and visualizations were used to explore temporal patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and anomalies.

2. **Time Series Decomposition:**
   Applied additive decomposition to break down the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. The components were visualized separately to better understand their individual contributions to the overall pattern.

3. **Stationarity Testing:**
   Checked the stationarity of the time series using two statistical methods:

   * **ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test**
   * **KPSS (Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin) Test**
     These tests were complemented with visual analysis using rolling statistics.

4. **Data Transformation and Stationarization:**
   The series was transformed to achieve stationarity by removing trend and seasonality through differencing and other preprocessing techniques. This step ensured the data was suitable for time series modeling.

5. **Model Selection with Auto ARIMA:**
   Leveraged the Auto ARIMA technique to automatically identify the optimal ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) based on AIC/BIC scores. This ensured model selection was both efficient and data-driven.

6. **Forecasting with SARIMAX:**
   Developed a seasonal ARIMA model with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) to account for seasonality and external influences. The final model was trained on the stationary series and used to generate accurate future forecasts.

**Highlights:**

* Detailed decomposition and stationarity handling with dual-method validation (ADF & KPSS)
* Fully visualized workflow to enhance interpretability and documentation
* Use of Auto ARIMA for efficient model selection
* Creation of a SARIMAX forecasting model tailored to the characteristics of the airline data

**Outcome:**
Successfully built a reliable and interpretable forecasting model that captures both trend and seasonal dynamics of airline passenger traffic. The project demonstrates a complete time series workflow with strong emphasis on visualization and statistical rigor.
